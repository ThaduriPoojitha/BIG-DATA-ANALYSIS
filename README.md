##YOU HAVE TO ENTER DESCRIPTION OF YOUR TASK This PySpark project demonstrates how to perform basic big data analysis using Spark DataFrames without the need to upload a CSV file. Instead, the dataset is created directly within the code using Python lists and PySpark's createDataFrame() method.

This is ideal for learning or testing purposes, especially in environments like Google Colab where you want a quick, file-free example.

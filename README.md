##YOU HAVE TO ENTER DESCRIPTION OF YOUR TASK 
This project demonstrates how to perform basic big data analysis using Apache Spark’s PySpark API, with a focus on building and analyzing a dataset without uploading any external CSV file. Instead, the dataset is created programmatically within the code to simulate a real-world dataset. This approach is useful for educational, testing, or demonstration purposes where quick execution and clarity are key.

The project is implemented entirely within Google Colab, a cloud-based Python environment, ensuring platform independence and ease of use. The PySpark engine is used to handle structured data, perform transformations, and carry out analytics efficiently — even though this example runs on a small local dataset, it can easily be scaled to work on large datasets in distributed environments.
